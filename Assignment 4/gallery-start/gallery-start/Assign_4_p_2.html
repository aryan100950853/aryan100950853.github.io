        This HTML file defines the framework of an image gallery. 
        It contains a div used to display a large image with a 
        darken/lighten button and a div that contains other small
        images. The file includes an external stylesheet file for
        styling, with a CSS extension and a scripting file for the
        interactive part of the gallery with JavaScript, as its extension is JS.
